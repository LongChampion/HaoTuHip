# Large bin attack
> LongChampion, 21/03/2020

According to source code, this attack is used to prepare for further attack by overwrite two addresses with a large value. The example is fully commented, but is still hard to follow. I think you want to read [CTF_Wiki](https://ctf-wiki.github.io/ctf-wiki/pwn/linux/glibc-heap/large_bin_attack/) for a simple version of this attack as well as how it work and a visualization.  
Please read the source code for more information and note.
